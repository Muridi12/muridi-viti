Steps on Configuring VPN Connection Between on-Prem and Prod-VPC

Step 1.
Launch an EC2 instance to use as OpenSwan Server in the public subnet of the on-prem VPC.
Open ports 22 and ICMP All Traffic IP4 to test connection. Keep not of Public IP of OpenSwan Server for later use.
Disable source/destination checks on OpenSwan Server to use it as the Customer Gateway Connection.
Launch another Instance similar to OpenSwan Server but donâ€™t disable the source/destination checks, this instance will be used as a test server for pinging.

Step 2.
Launch an EC2 instance on the Prod VPC with ports 22 and ICMP traffic open.

Step 3.
Create a customer gateway, set the route to static, and use the Public IP of OpenSwan Server.

Step 4. 
Create a Virtual Gateway and attach it to Prod VPC.

Step. 5 
Create a VPN connection, target type Virtual Private Gateways, select the CGW and VGW created in previous steps.
Static route prefix:
On-prem is the local route and Prod VPC is the remote route.

Step 6.
Download the VPN configuration as OpenSwan type.

Step 7.
Configure the OpenSwan instance on perm VPC following the  configuration file that was downloaded.
Install OpenSwan on instance and start ipsec service.

Step. 8
Test Connection by pinging from on prem server to server on Prod VPC.
